This project is a Python implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game with an interactive command-line interface. It features simple gameplay, score tracking, and the option to end the game anytime by typing 'End'. The program uses Python's `random.choice` for the computer's moves and includes game logic to determine the winner.
